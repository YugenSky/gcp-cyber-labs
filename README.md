## Portfolio Overview

Each lab demonstrates practical cybersecurity skills aligned with industry practices:

- **Create symmetric and asymmetric keys**  
  *Implemented cryptographic key management using Google Cloud KMS; demonstrated symmetric and asymmetric key generation, usage policies, and lifecycle security.*

- **Determine the difference between normal activity and an incident**  
  *Analyzed system and log data to distinguish between baseline activity and actual security incidents; developed escalation criteria and incident classification processes.*

- **Explore false positives through incident detection**  
  *Investigated detection alerts to identify false positives, improved SOC workflows by tuning rules, and reduced noise in incident queues.*

- **Recover VMs with Google**  
  *Performed disaster recovery by restoring virtual machines from snapshots and backups in Google Cloud; validated post-recovery system integrity.*

- **Analyze audit logs using BigQuery**  
  *Queried and analyzed Google Cloud audit logs with BigQuery to uncover anomalies, build detection logic, and support compliance reporting.*
