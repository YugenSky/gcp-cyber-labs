- Log analysis and detection engineering with BigQuery
- Key management, symmetric vs asymmetric cryptography
- Alert triage and false-positive reduction
- Evidence collection and post-incident actions

## How to Use
1. Open a lab under `labs/` and follow its README.
2. Add screenshots to `evidence/` and exports to `artifacts/`.
3. Commit changes and push to GitHub.

## Notes
This repo contains no secrets or proprietary data. Examples are safe placeholders you can adapt in a sandbox project.


## Portfolio Overview (Resume Mapping)

Each lab demonstrates practical cybersecurity skills aligned with industry practices:

- **Create symmetric and asymmetric keys**  
  *Implemented cryptographic key management using Google Cloud KMS; demonstrated symmetric and asymmetric key generation, usage policies, and lifecycle security.*

- **Determine the difference between normal activity and an incident**  
  *Analyzed system and log data to distinguish between baseline activity and actual security incidents; developed escalation criteria and incident classification processes.*

- **Explore false positives through incident detection**  
  *Investigated detection alerts to identify false positives, improved SOC workflows by tuning rules, and reduced noise in incident queues.*

- **Recover VMs with Google**  
  *Performed disaster recovery by restoring virtual machines from snapshots and backups in Google Cloud; validated post-recovery system integrity.*

- **Analyze audit logs using BigQuery**  
  *Queried and analyzed Google Cloud audit logs with BigQuery to uncover anomalies, build detection logic, and support compliance reporting.*

This portfolio highlights applied experience across key domains: **cloud incident response, detection engineering, key management, SOC analysis, and disaster recovery**.
